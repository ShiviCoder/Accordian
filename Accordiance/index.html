            The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence defined by recurrence. Fibonacci (Leonardo de Pisa) first made it known by using it to solve a problem. It states that each number is equal to the sum of the two preceding numbers. It starts with the following 14 integers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233.
